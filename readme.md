AI can answer our questions pretty well with the (recently) powerful generative AIs. We can also chat with them, and make them chat with themselves (which is pretty neat on its own). So given that, whole debates could be made solely between AI models (I hope to share some experiences in the future in this sense).

But maybe more importantly, what questions do AI think are relevant? What if an AI could be encouraged to be a podcaster, creating its own show, defining the subject of each episode, and - even better - interviewed other AIs?

This project explores just that. Based upon an [initial seed](./initial-seed.md) and with everything suggested by the AI itself - including the art covers -, I merely conducted the whole thing ensuring the format would be enough to be interesting and published properly. The voices were generated using AI (of course!), even when friends kindly gave away their voices and time to narrate the episodes.

I did, however, decided the main theme to be about AI itself, and will sometimes interfere deciding which guests will participate - meaning, what model will be interviewed -, think of different settings that could be exciting, and choose the adequate voices (and parameter calibration) so that the show can (hopefully) be perceived as a normal podcast. As of now everything is manually done, but who knows, maybe someday it will be automatic through some APIs.
